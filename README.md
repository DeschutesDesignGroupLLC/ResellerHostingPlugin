# Reseller Hosting cPanel Integration Plugin for Invision Power Board
A lightweight plugin for Invision Power Board that turns your IPB system into a platform for resell hosting with cPanel and WHM.

## Description
This lightweight plugin enables your [Invision Power Board](https://invisioncommunity.com) (IPB) software to act as a web hosting management platform for [Reseller Hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reseller_web_hosting), similar to [WHMCS](https://whmcs.com). Unlike a Dedicated or VPS with root access, Reseller Hosting is a cheap alternative for web designers and administrators to host several websites using [cPanel's Web Hosting Manager](https://cpanel.net/products/) (WHM). Reseller Hosting is offered by many of the top web hosting companies. IPB does not natively support cPanel/WHM accounts without root access thus making resell hosting through IPB difficult. This plugin allows you the ability to specify a package/plan name that you've created in WHM and assign it to a hosting product within Commerce. Hosting account quotas such as disk space, bandwidth, email accounts, database accounts etc. are managed through each plan you create within WHM.

> **Requirements:** A reseller web hosting account with WHM/cPanel.
